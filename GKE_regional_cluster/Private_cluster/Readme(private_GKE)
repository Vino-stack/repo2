Deploy Private-GKE regional cluster

1.Configure network setup needed . Subnet should have primary and two secondary IP ranges(network.tf)

2.configure Cluster creation with required private_cluster_config(nodes ll have private IP only) defined.

3.The Master node, which is hosted on a Google-Managed project, communicates with the nodes via VPC peering(This peering is automatically set up by Google and should not be modified or removed).

3.Need to define a Cloud NAT in front of our nodes. The NAT provides a public IP in front of all nodes along with router.

4.Additionally Bastion host(VM instance) can be  configured where (Kubectl binaries installed,k8s cluster config enable for accessing cluster from this bastion host)

5.Flow will be 
      Internet -> Cloud NAT <- Worker nodes <---Peering---> Master node
      Admin -> Bastion host( to apply/deploy apps/changes to cluster)
