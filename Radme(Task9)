Steps for deploying static website on cloud storage:

1.Creating a cloud storage bucket with Default storage class

2.Uploading your sample site's files(HTML/JS/CSS)

3.Sharing your files to make  objects in your bucket readable to everyone on the public internet
    Assing Storage Object Viewer role to all users.
   
4.Assigning specialty pages controlled by the MainPageSuffix property and NotFoundPage property
    Use the gsutil web set command to set the MainPageSuffix property with the -m flag and the NotFoundPage with the -e flag:
    
5.Set your load balancer and SSL certificate
    Configuring the backend(select your backend bucket)
    Configuring host rules and path matchers(for rewrting 
    Configuring the frontend (HTTPS protocol and create an SSL certificate,also Reserve a new static IP address )
    
6.Connecting your domain to your load balance(optional)

7.Check Monitoring the SSL certificate status

8.Test your website
    Once the SSL certificate is active, verify that content is served from the bucket by going to https://www.example.com/test.html,
    where test.html is an object stored in the bucket that you're using as the backend. 
    If you set the MainPageSuffix property, https://www.example.com goes to index.html.
