Cloud Functions


Cloud Functions are either HTTP based functions or event-driven functions. 
Depending on runtime you use, event-driven can either be BackGround functions(Node.js, Python, Go, and Java) or Cloud Event Functions(.NET, Ruby, and PHP)

HTTP functions
You invoke HTTP functions from standard HTTP requests. 
These HTTP requests wait for the response and support handling of common HTTP request methods like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE and OPTIONS.

Event-driven functions
Cloud Functions uses event-driven functions to handle events from your Cloud infrastructure, 
such as messages on a Pub/Sub topic, or changes in a Cloud Storage bucket.
Cloud Functions supports two sub-types of event-driven functions:
    Background functions
    CloudEvent functions

Structuring source code:
